/* There is a network of N (initial parameter) sensors given.
// Each sensor is connected to M other sensors (initial parameter) - randomly selected.
// Sensors can exchange messages between themselves.

// Initially,
// each sensor has a one message with one specific recipient, which message
// has to be sent to a randomly chosen neighbor/recipient (of connected sensor)
// if he is not the addressee of precisely this message. The task is to write
// a simulation in which each sensor will operate in its own thread
//  (a necessary condition). The completion of the task is to stop the
// transmission. The simulator has to be designed in the way â€“ that for each
//  message counts the number of times it has been communicated/transmitted
// (hop count) and writes to the standard output below histogram:

// N-hops      M-times
// R-hops      S-times

// At the same time it has to be sorted in ascending order by the number of hops.
// The application should work seamlessly with large numbers of threads (MUST condition!).
// This means no "busy waiting"
